# data-512-a1

This repository is for housing the "A1: Data Curation" project for the DATA 512 FA20 course in the MSDS program.

The goal of the project is to create a chart visualization for the mobile, desktop and combined wikipedia traffic views from 2008 to 2020. The final visualization should look similar enough to the one in the file En-wikipedia_traffic_200801-201709_thompson.png. 

The actual final visualization created in the project can be seen in the file A1_viz.png.
