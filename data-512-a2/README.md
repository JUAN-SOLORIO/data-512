# DATA 512 FA2020
# A2: Bias in Data
Author: Juan Solorio

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to identify what, if any, sources of bias may exist in the Wikipedia Talk corpus and the implications that rise from these.

This assignment focuses on the annotations done for the [Wikipedia Talk]( https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox) corpus, consisting of three datasets. The dataset contains 160k labeled comments in English Wikipedia from an original corpus of 64M comments from discussions relating to user pages and articles dating from 2004-2015. Each of the comments were labeled by at least 10 annotators via Crowdflower for the level of toxicity, aggression, and personal attack of a comment in progressing or ending a discourse.
All the data collected by wikimedia can be accessed under free licenses via [figshare]( https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Toxicity/4563973) and per wikimedia [open access policy]( https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Open_access_policy).
