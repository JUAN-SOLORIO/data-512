    "\n",
    "Police violence and excess force or police brutality have always been a major area of concern for citizens especially among minority and underrepresented communities. In more recent times, over the last few months we’ve experience the social unrest and rightful outcry through the use of protests and marches from these communities to call out said brutality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking [mappingpoliceviolence.org]( https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) as reference, in 2020 alone, police have killed over 800 people across the United States. With Black people making up 28% of those killed by police.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I plan to explore the demographics of police officers involved in shootings and use of force from the city of Seattle to gain a better understanding as to how might this have an effect on the type of response taken by said officers.\n"

    "1. Are certain demographics of police officers more likely to be involved in shootings?\n",
    "    - are there certain pairing of police-to-victim demographics that appear more in the data?\n",
    "2. Is there a precinct (geographical location) that shows more propencity to using force?\n",
