    "\n",
    "Police violence and excess force or police brutality have always been a major area of concern for citizens especially among minority and underrepresented communities. In more recent times, over the last few months weâ€™ve experience the social unrest and rightful outcry through the use of protests and marches from these communities to call out said brutality. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I plan to explore the demographics of police officers involved in shootings and use of force from the city of Seattle to gain a better understanding as to how might this have an effect on the type of response taken by said officers.\n"

    "For the project I will be using the data provided by the [City of Seattle Open Data Program]( https://data.seattle.gov/browse?category=Public+Safety&provenance=official&page=2). Primarily I will be using two datasets, one for [SPD Officer Involved Shooting]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Officer-Involved-Shooting-OIS-Data/mg5r-efcm) and one for [Police Use of Force]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets contain demographic information on both Police Officers involved in the offence as well as that of the civilian victim. The data also contains geographical and temporal information which could give better insights as to how these events are affected by location or time.\n"
