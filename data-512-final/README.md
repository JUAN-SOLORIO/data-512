# Human Centered Data Science Final Project

**DATA 512 A Fall 2020** 

Juan Solorio

## Proposal & Motivation

Police violence and excess force or police brutality have always been a major area of concern for citizens especially among minority and underrepresented communities. In more recent times, over the last few months weâ€™ve experience the social unrest and rightful outcry through the use of protests and marches from these communities to call out said brutality. 
For this project I plan to explore the demographics of police officers involved in shootings and use of force from the city of Seattle to gain a better understanding as to how might this have an effect on the type of response taken by said officers.


## Data

Primarily I will be using three datasets one for [SPD Officer Involved Shooting]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Officer-Involved-Shooting-OIS-Data/mg5r-efcm), one for [Police Use of Force]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj), and one for [Seattle PD Officers respoding to Crisis Calls]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crisis-Data/i2q9-thny). 

These datasets contain demographic information on Police Officers involved in the offence as well as that of the civilian victim. The data also contains geographical and temporal information which could give better insights as to how these events are affected by location or time.
