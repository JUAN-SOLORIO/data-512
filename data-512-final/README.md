# Human Centered Data Science Final Project

**DATA 512 A Fall 2020** 

Juan Solorio

## Proposal & Motivation

Police violence and excess force or police brutality have always been a major area of concern for citizens especially among minority and underrepresented communities. In more recent times, over the last few months weâ€™ve experience the social unrest and rightful outcry through the use of protests and marches from these communities to call out said brutality. 
For this project I plan to explore the demographics of police officers involved in shootings and use of force from the city of Seattle to gain a better understanding as to how might this have an effect on the type of response taken by said officers.


## Data

Primarily I will be using two datasets, one for [SPD Officer Involved Shooting]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Officer-Involved-Shooting-OIS-Data/mg5r-efcm) and one for [Police Use of Force]( https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj). 
Both of these datasets are available through the City of Seattle's [Open Data Program](https://data.seattle.gov/browse?category=Public+Safety&provenance=official&page=2).
